## 3.0.0 - Framework Rewrite [2023-09-xx]

To ease of development for future maintainer or anyone who is much more comfortable with framework rather than raw dog HTML. As much as I prefer working on vanilla side for performance reason, I do want people to contribute without hassle and I find Astro+SolidJS to be solid (ha) choice for performance and ease of development balance.

### Added

-  Linkin Park 2.0 environment & color scheme
-  Info color scheme for color picker

### Changed

-  The Weeknd and Panic 2.0 color scheme now shows white color value
-  Internal structure rewrite
-  Slightly better styling
-  Custom color now save between select and override where applicable
