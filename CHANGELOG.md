## 3.0.0 - Framework Rewrite [2024-12-xx]

To ease of development for future maintainer or anyone who is much more comfortable with framework rather than raw dog HTML. As much as I prefer working on vanilla side for performance reason, I do want people to contribute without hassle and I find Astro+SolidJS to be solid (ha) choice for performance and ease of development balance.
